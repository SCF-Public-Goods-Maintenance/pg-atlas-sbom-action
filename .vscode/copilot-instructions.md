# Global Instructions

## Architecture Documentation

When architectural context is needed, do not guess. Instead, use your GitHub tools to explore the
`SCF-Public-Goods-Maintenance/scf-public-goods-maintenance.github.io` repository. Start by listing
the `docs/` directory, then read only the .md files relevant to the current task.

## Docs

Always document your work. When the output is code, write clear docstrings for each function. If it
is not obvious where to document your work, create a new .md file.

## Tests

Whenever possible, write test cases to validate your work. Do not hesitate to write unit tests. If
you need to write a larger integration test or GitHub workflow, ask for user input first.

## Git & Version Control

Never run `git add`, `git stage`, `git commit`, `git push`, or any equivalent (including GitHub MCP
`push_files` / `create_or_update_file` to the repo) without **explicit user approval**. Prepare
changes in the working tree, summarize what is ready, and wait for the user to review before any
commit is created.

## Keeping These Instructions Current

After completing a todo list for a session, append any new conventions, decisions, or patterns that
would help future sessions collaborate smoothly. Remove anything that was superseded. This file is
the hand-off document between sessions.
